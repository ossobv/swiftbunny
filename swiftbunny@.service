Description=Drain RabbitMQ and publish to OpenStack Swift (%i)
After=network.target
# Depending on which RabbitMQ you need to reach, alter/add this
# in /etc/systemd/system/swiftbunny@.service.d/override.conf:
#   After=docker@rabbitmq-server.service

# Allow at most 5 restarts in 10 minutes. After that, we go into failed state.
# Check RestartSec= below: StartLimitBurst*RestartSec must be lower than
# StartLimitIntervalSec. Otherwise this won't work.
# After 5th failure, we should get notified by either psdiff(1) or the
# monitoring of `systemctl list-units --failed`
StartLimitIntervalSec=10m
StartLimitBurst=5
